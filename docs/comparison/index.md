## Detailed comparisons

- [vs. dbt Semantic Layer (MetricFlow)](dbt.md) — coupled to dbt projects, served via dbt Cloud
- [vs. Malloy](malloy.md) — a query language with semantic modeling, plus the Publisher REST/MCP server
- [vs. LookML / Looker](lookml.md) — the proprietary modeling language behind Google Cloud Looker
- [vs. Cube](cube.md) — the OSS production semantic layer with pre-aggregations and multi-API parity (Postgres wire, REST, GraphQL)
- [vs. AtScale](atscale.md) — the enterprise universal semantic layer with native MDX/DAX for Excel and Power BI live connections

## Topology: a recurring theme

Most semantic layers assume a **single-rooted, tree-shaped** model (one fact at the center, dimensions fanning out). OBSL is built on a **directed join graph (DAG)** that supports:

- **Star** and **snowflake** schemas (the common cases)
- **Multi-rooted** models — query across multiple unrelated facts in a single semantic surface, resolved via the **CFL (Composite Fact Layer)** planner that emits `UNION ALL` legs
- **Multi-path** joins — multiple valid join paths between the same pair of objects, named via `pathName` and selected per query via `usePathNames`
- **Cycle detection** — explicit, not silent

This matters when your warehouse doesn't fit a clean star: you need ship-address vs. billing-address joins to the same dimension, or a single API surface that exposes revenue *and* support tickets together. See the [Compilation Pipeline](../guide/compilation.md) guide for how this flows through the planner.

### How each tool actually handles multi-fact queries

Two separate questions matter here, and they cut differently across tools:

1. **Modeling-time**: does the language let you declare independent peer entities (multiple facts) with their own joins to shared dimensions, or are joins scoped to a single base context (one explore, one source) so peer-rooted topology can't be expressed at all?
2. **Query-time**: when a query asks for measures from multiple facts, is the SQL plan a single `JOIN` graph (with fanout risk, mitigated by symmetric aggregates) or `UNION ALL` legs?

A constraint that's universal: every tool here requires you to **declare entities (tables/cubes/sources/dataObjects) first** — you can't ad-hoc add a join to an undefined table. The differences are about how those declared entities can be wired together.

| Tool | Peer-rooted modeling | Multi-fact query plan |
|---|---|---|
| **OBSL** | ✅ `dataObjects` are independent peers, each with its own joins | `UNION ALL` legs (CFL) with NULL-padding for missing measures |
| **dbt SL (MetricFlow)** | ✅ `semantic_models` are independent peers; joins via shared entities | `FULL OUTER JOIN` on the shared entity (per dbt's `join-logic.md`) |
| **Malloy** | ❌ every `source` is single-rooted; `join_one` / `join_many` always presume one root | n/a (separate queries) |
| **LookML** | ❌ joins live inside one `explore` (one base view + joined views) | JOIN inside the explore (symmetric agg) |
| **Looker (runtime)** | n/a | `merged_results` merges two queries' results in the API layer |
| **Cube** | ✅ cubes are independent peers with `joins` blocks; planner traverses the cube graph (Dijkstra) — *shortest path is not always the semantically correct one* | Single JOIN path resolved at query time; `views` recommended when multiple paths exist |
| **AtScale** | ✅ multiple fact datasets in one Cube connected by conformed dimensions; virtual cubes compose Cubes | JOIN with OLAP-style aggregation |

So **peer-rooted modeling** isn't unique to OBSL — Cube, dbt MetricFlow, and AtScale all support it. **Single-rooted-only** sits with Malloy and LookML, by language design.

The **multi-fact query plans split three ways**, and the correctness story is non-trivial for two of them:

- **`UNION ALL` (OBSL)** — one leg per fact; each leg `SELECT … FROM fact_n JOIN dims … GROUP BY …`. The two facts are *never in the same `FROM` clause*, so the **chasm trap** (cross-product when both facts have multiple rows per shared dim key) cannot occur by construction. No symmetric-aggregate accounting required. The cost is two SQL passes, one per leg.

- **`FULL OUTER JOIN` on shared entity (dbt MetricFlow)** — peer fact tables joined on the entity. **Correctness depends on pre-aggregating each side before the join**: if `sales` has 3 rows for user_1 and `returns` has 2, a raw `FROM sales FULL OUTER JOIN returns ON user_id` produces 6 rows and inflated sums. MetricFlow handles this via per-side aggregation CTEs before the FULL OUTER JOIN, but the pattern gets more delicate when the query also groups by additional dimensions or mixes measure types.

- **Single JOIN path with symmetric aggregates (Cube, LookML, AtScale)** — planner picks one path through the join graph (Dijkstra in Cube; explore-base-rooted in LookML; OLAP aggregation in AtScale) and wraps each measure's aggregation in **symmetric-aggregate** SQL (DISTINCT-aware SUMs, COUNT(DISTINCT …) over surrogate keys, etc.) to undo the fanout the JOIN introduces. Works for many common shapes — but it's a *correction during aggregation* rather than a structural fix, and edge cases (multiple unique-distinct columns, nested aggregations, mixed COUNT/SUM) can still produce surprising numbers. Cube's own docs recommend `views` for "join predictability and stability" — i.e., pin the path at model-design time rather than trusting the planner to pick correctly.

OBSL's UNION ALL plan trades extra SQL passes for the absence of an entire class of fanout problem.

For **multi-path joins** between the same pair of entities (e.g., `Order.ship_address_id` vs `Order.bill_address_id` both pointing to `Address`):

- **OBSL**: declare both with `secondary: true` + `pathName`; pick at query time via `usePathNames`. **Per-query selection — unique here.**
- **Cube**: graph allows multiple paths; planner resolves with Dijkstra + a member-type priority heuristic (measures → dimensions → segments → time dimensions); pin via a `view` for predictability. **Graph-aware but not per-query selectable** — and the choice of *shortest path* is a graph-theoretic answer to what is fundamentally a semantic question. When a query asks for "orders by address," shortest-path picks one of `ship_address_id` / `bill_address_id` based on edge weights, not on the consumer's intent. The two paths may yield genuinely different correct answers; Dijkstra picks the one the heuristic prefers. Views can pin the choice, but only at model-design time, not per query.
- **AtScale**: role-playing dimensions — same dim aliased into multiple roles (`OrderDate`, `ShipDate`). Model-time aliasing.
- **LookML**: `from` aliasing — same view declared twice in an explore under different aliases. Model-time.
- **Malloy**: aliased sources (`source: ship_addr is address`). Model-time.
- **dbt MetricFlow**: no first-class path-name primitive.

**What's structurally distinct about OBSL** after the corrections:

1. **`UNION ALL` plan avoids the chasm trap by construction** — the two facts never share a `FROM` clause, so cross-product fanout is impossible. MetricFlow's `FULL OUTER JOIN` and Cube/LookML/AtScale's single-JOIN-path approach both have to *correct for* fanout (via pre-aggregation CTEs or symmetric aggregates respectively); CFL avoids needing a correction at all.
2. **Per-query path selection** for multi-path joins — Cube has graph-aware multi-path resolution (heuristic), but OBSL is the only one where the *consumer of the query* picks the path explicitly. Shortest-path is a graph-theoretic answer to a semantic question.
3. **Static fanout detection** as an explicit error class (`compiler/fanout.py` raises `FanoutError`) — wrong-direction many-to-one joins fail at compile time rather than producing silently-wrong row counts.

AtScale's conformed-dimensions-within-a-Cube + virtual cubes is the closest peer in *modeling capability*. Nothing in this comparison set matches OBSL's *combination* of UNION-ALL multi-fact plan + per-query path selection.

## Where OBSL fits best

- **Embedded analytics** in a SaaS product where consumers (apps, agents, BI tools) need a stable JSON Query API and you don't want to ship a DSL interpreter.
- **Multi-tenant** semantic models with TTL-scoped sessions.
- **LLM/agent integration** via MCP — a clean, schema-driven query surface beats teaching the agent a new language.
- **Modern cloud warehouses** including ClickHouse, Databricks, Dremio, and DuckDB.
- **Open-source / self-hostable / air-gapped** deployments.

## Where another tool may be a better fit

- **dbt SL** if you've standardized on dbt and want metrics tightly coupled to your transformation pipeline, with dbt Cloud governance.
- **Malloy** for analyst-driven exploration and BI authoring, especially if you need hierarchical (`nest`) result shapes.
- **Looker** if you're buying an end-to-end BI platform with dashboards, alerts, RLS, and PDTs — and the per-user licensing fits your org.
- **Cube** if you need pre-aggregations for sub-second analytics on large datasets or first-class multi-tenancy/RLS — and you're willing to operate (or pay for Cube Cloud to operate) the heavier runtime. (PostgreSQL-wire BI connectivity is no longer a Cube exclusive — OBSL also speaks it as of v2.5.0.)
- **AtScale** if your business users live in Excel pivot tables and need native MDX, or you need DAX for Power BI live connections — no other tool in this comparison set speaks those protocols.

These tools are not mutually exclusive — it's plausible to ship a BI platform (Looker / AtScale) for the human audience and OBSL alongside it for the embedded / API / agent audience.

## About OSI

Several comparisons reference **OSI (Open Semantic Interchange)** — an open standard for portable semantic models, founded to let metric and dimension definitions move between BI tools, semantic layers, and data platforms without rewriting. See [open-semantic-interchange.org](https://open-semantic-interchange.org/) for the specification.

OBSL ships bidirectional converters (`POST /v1/convert/osi-to-obml`, `POST /v1/convert/obml-to-osi`) and Import/Export buttons in the Gradio playground. AtScale is a founding contributor to the OSI initiative; the other tools in this comparison do not currently support OSI directly. See the [OSI Interoperability](../guide/osi.md) guide for usage details.
